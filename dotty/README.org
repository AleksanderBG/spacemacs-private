* Dotty layer

** lsp support
  
*** Configuration
    This layer needs Coursier (https://github.com/coursier/coursier) to run Dotty LSP.

    You also need to build LSP and install it locally.

    To do that, run the following commands in SBT:
    
    #+begin_src text
        ;configureIDE ;publishLocal ;dotty-interfaces/publishLocal ;tasty-core-bootstrapped/publishLocal ;dotty-library-bootstrapped/publishLocal ;dotty-compiler-bootstrapped/publishLocal ;dotty-language-server/publishLocal
    #+end_src
    
    The above comprises the following commands:
    
    #+begin_src text
      configureIDE
      dotty-interfaces/publishLocal
      tasty-core-bootstrapped/publishLocal
      dotty-library-bootstrapped/publishLocal
      dotty-compiler-bootstrapped/publishLocal
      dotty-language-server/publishLocal
    #+end_src
    
    Typically it's useful to build LSP at the point one branched off =master=. This commit can be checked out using:

    #+begin_src bash
      git checkout $(git merge-base master HEAD)
    #+end_src
    
*** Keybindings
   
   Useful LSP keybindings:
   
   | Keybindings              | Description            |
   | -------------            | --------------         |
   | ~SPC SPC lsp~            | Start LSP mode         |
   | ~SPC SPC lsp-disconnect~ | Stop LSP mode          |
   | ~, b r~                  | Restart (a) LSP server |

   Dotty LSP likes to crash from time to time, so restarting the server is useful.
   
   LSP logs can be viewed with:

   | Keybindings                   | Description                                                           |
   | -------------                 | --------------                                                        |
   | ~SPC b B *dotty-lsp::stderr*~ | Stderr of Dotty LSP (more useful)                                     |
   | ~SPC b B *dotty-lsp*~         | Stdout of Dotty LSP (needs to be turned on to be logged, less useful) |
